                                <p><span>TableShare</span> was designed as a potential solution for making a caf&eacute; a more productive and collaborative environment for adult students and workers. It builds upon the findings that adults studying and working at a caf&eacute; typically work alone but are willing to share their workspace with other focused students and workers.</p>
                                <p><span>TableShare</span> allows users to get to work faster by providing relevant information about how many tables are available to work at and who a user can potentially sit with. The app may minimize the chance a user and customer must leave the caf&eacute; for lack of seating. The app may also minimize interruptions by others asking to share a table. As a result, a caf&eacute; owner may provide a more consistent and predictable working environment.</p>

                    <p>For this project, I followed the <span>Double Diamond process</span> of discovery, synthesis, and several rounds of design and refinement. After deducing and synthesizing insights from several interviews, I found an opportunity to create an app that allows users to find tables to share in crowded cafes. Several <span>usability tests</span> brought out significant pain points to address. These results allowed me to make significant improvements in the user flow and design in the following iterations.</p>

                    <p>Affinity mapping of the interview data resulted in the understanding that adult learners were primarily interested in studying or working alone but around similarly-minded/focused adults.</p>

                    <p>For the fourth Hi&ndash;Fi iteration, I wanted to address the landing page. I updated the screen to provide users with real-time information about the caf&eacute; and their points accumulated from sharing tables, redeemable as dollars. Additionally, I updated the symbols and components to make options, the flow, and state changes clearer.</p>

                    <h1>Retrospective</h1>
                    <h2>What went well?</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Using UI Kits for wireframing and iPhone iOS components allowed for faster and, eventually, more realistic prototyping.</li>
                        <li>Usability testing brought out significant pain points to address, allowing me to make significant improvements in the iterations directly after testing.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h2>Areas for Improvement</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>It was sometimes difficult to understand how much to prime usability test participants, I had difficulty determining how much to allow participants to know.</li>
                        <li>Finding participants to test prototypes was difficult.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h2>Constraints & Considerations</h2>
                    <p><span>TableShare</span> essentially turns each caf&eacute; table into a potential coworking space. However, this is not permanent. A table&rsquo;s status is dynamic and may change according to who is seated there. In order to be implemented, TableShare may require at least a part of the caf&eacute; devoted to app users.</p>
                    <h2>Next Steps</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Add more testing throughout development</li>
                        <li>Determine more places to quickly recruit participants</li>
                        <li>Explore Onboarding of <span>TableShare</span></li>
                    </ul>
