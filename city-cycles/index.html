                    <h1>Summary</h1>
                    <p>Through the UX Audit, I determined pain points and opportunities to enhance a reservation system. My UX redesign involved considerations for users&rsquo; mental model of a reservation system, progressive disclosure, interaction design and mobile responsiveness and development.</p>

            <section id="cc-ux-audit">
                <div class="full-width">
                    <h1>UX Audit &mdash; Exploration &amp; Findings</h1>
                    <p>I reviewed analytics and conducted a user interview, usability test, heuristic evaluation and competitive analysis to determine the points of failure and opportunity for the reservation system. I further visualized the findings with the development of a persona and journey map.</p>
                    <h2>Metrics &amp; User Analytics Review</h2>
                    <p>Of the analytics provided in the brief, the reported drop-off of 80% of users during mid-reservation and only 25% of users scrolling to view content below the fold, were of greatest note to me.</p>
                    <h2>Stakeholder Interview Review</h2>
                    <p>The provided brief noted City Cycles&rsquo; frustration with fielding excessive phone calls and in-person reservations. These interruptions made it difficult &ldquo; to provide quality customer service.&rdquo; They would like to know why patrons are avoiding what is in place online.</p>
                    <h2>Conducted User Interview &amp; Usability Test</h2>
                    <p>User research revealed a confusing booking experience in which the reservation flow&rsquo;s requirements, conflicting directions and labeling bewildered the user.</p>

                    <h2>Conducted Heuristic Evaluation</h2>
                    <p>The heuristic evaluation revealed a violation of several heuristics that contributed to an unpredictable reservation flow with high cognitive friction.</p>

                    <p>A potential City Cycles&rsquo; customer looking to quickly book a bicycle adventure would have an emotional rollercoaster of a journey ending in frustration. The journey map identified issues with the website&rsquo;s navigation, an excessive number of steps in the flow and a lack of readily available contact information.</p>

                    <h2>Competitive Analysis</h2>
                    <p>Reviewing the online rental process for other rental stores revealed opportunities to: 1) create a more flexible reservation system that allowed patrons to book an hourly rate and book quickly 2) create a more visual reservation system</p>

            <!-- UX REDESIGN -->

                <div class="full-width">
                    <h1>UX Redesign</h1>
                    <h2>First Iteration &mdash; Homepage Layout</h2>
                    <p>My first iteration focused on addressing the website&rsquo;s navigation menu, search bar placement and overall homepage layout.</p>
                    <div class="cc-ux-redesign-flex-lo-fi">
                        <div>

                        <h3>IMAGE &mdash; Original vs. First Iteration Mockup</h3>
                    </div>
                    <p>I updated the navigation to more logical options via a card sorting exercise. I moved the search bar closer to the menu to improve visibility. I added large CTA buttons to draw the user&rsquo;s focus to the most desired action stakeholders and users wanted &mdash; to make a reservation. Additionally, I added the CTA &lsquo;Book Now&rsquo; button to the navigation so the reservation system could be easily accessed from other parts of the site. I relocated the introductory text as it was of secondary importance.</p>
                    <h2>First Iteration &mdash; Updated Flow</h2>
                    <p>My first iteration also focused on simplifying the user flow to match the typical mental model of a reservation system: Booking CTA &gt; Reservation Form &gt; Confirmation.</p>
                     <div class="cc-ux-redesign-flex-flow">

                    </div>
                    <h2>First Iteration &mdash; Convert Text&ndash;Heavy Instructions to Visual Options </h2>
                    <p>I focused on converting the wall of text instructions to actionable options. What I could not convert to an actionable option, I used bolded text to support skimming.</p>
                    <div class="cc-ux-redesign-flex-form">

                    <h2>First Iteration &mdash; Usability Test &amp; Resulting Update </h2>
                    <p>The Usability Test revealed a more personalized confirmation message was desired to make the user feel more the secure that the reservation was received.</p>

                    <h2>Second Iteration</h2>
                    <p>I decided to revisit the reservation system to further enhance the experience, interaction design and mobile optimization. And further explore the opportunities competitive analysis revealed: create a more flexible reservation system that allowed patrons to book an hourly rate and book quickly.</p>
                    <h2>Second Iteration &mdash; Homepage Update</h2>
                    <p>Since the focus was on increasing online reservations, I decided to allow users to begin the reservation process from the landing page. I also wanted to keep most of the information above the fold.</p>
                    <div class="full-width cc-it-2-homepage">
                        <img src="../img/cc-it-2-homepage.png" alt="Second Iteration Homepage" />
                    </div>
                    <h2>Second Iteration &mdash; Desktop &mdash; Embraced Progressive Disclosure and Interaction Design</h2>
                    <p>Again, I worked to keep everything above the fold and embraced interaction design to guide the user quickly through the options. I used a blue indicator box to provide the user with feedback: where they should focus their attention when the page loaded and after a choice was selected. I added social proof to make the user&rsquo;s selection easier. I used progressive disclosure to shorten the form and a slide in motion between screens to make the user feel they are progressing through the process.</p>

                    <h2>Second Iteration &mdash; Mobile Considerations</h2>
                    <p>While horizontal scrolling allowed me to keep most of the second screen above the fold, I allowed for vertical scrolling in order to complete the contact and payment information. I thought this would allow for a responsive website that collects the user information in the same manner as the desktop site (i.e. there would be no need to maintain multiple sites as in an adaptive solution).</p>

                    <p>Although I approached this project as that of a client with a modest budget, it was still difficult to determine what could be added, feature&ndash;wise, within such a budget. This was a good exercise to understand the importance of business strategy and how that can play a role in revamping offerings and how they are presented to customers. Additionally, this exercise emphasized the importance of conversations with stakeholders and developers. I would have collected more data to determine best offerings and considered exploring additional features that might set the company apart from competition. I attempted to make decisions with a developer in mind; however, it would have been helpful to further discus, with a developer, whether my choices were efficient or time&ndash; or budget&ndash;friendly.</p>
